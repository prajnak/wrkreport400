### Technical Communication Critical Feedback
	Your introduction does not contain a clear objective statement for your report, and your conclusion does not satisfy the report objective (because no clear objective is stated).

	Your introduction must include a statement that clearly and concisely defines the objective of the report, and what it will accomplish. Your conclusion must clearly indicate if this objective was satisfied, and how this was done.

	You are also required to have at least one in-text reference in your introduction.

	Your summary is far too long. Summaries for professional reports should be approximately 1 page.

	For next time, consider giving less background information. This will be easier once you clearly define a report objective.
	
	For your resubmit, please fix the introduction and conclusions in the ways indicated above.
